                    <h2>Smart Health: I Tried the Rolflex Pro for Sore Muscles — and It Helped Ease Painful Spots</h2>
                    <h5>Dec 7, 2017</h5><br>
                    <div>
                        <img src="../images/art3.jpg" width="700" height="345">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Why I Tried It To relieve muscle soreness and tension after strenuous
                         strength training sessions

                        As a personal trainer and mat Pilates instructor, I make exercise a part of my daily routine.
                        And most days include some strength training. Consistency does not leave me immune from the
                        occasional sore spot or tight muscle a day or two after a tough workout.

                        So, I do leave time after my workouts to cool down with the help of a stretching band or a
                        foam roller. (Some research does indeed suggest that foam rolling can help with post-workout
                        muscle soreness. A meta-analysis published in Frontiers in Physiology in April 2019 concluded
                        foam rolling is as a warm-up activity can improve flexibility and as a recovery tool can
                            help reduce pain after a workout.)

                        The Rolflex Pro, a self-massage tool designed to be more portable and more easily target
                        hard-to-reach muscles than a traditional foam roller, piqued my interest.

                        Could this nifty tool really elevate my workout performance?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What Is the Rolflex Pro?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It’s designed to relieve muscle pain and promote muscle recovery. But unlike 
                        traditional foam rollers, which require you to use your body weight to apply
                         pressure to painful areas, the Rolflex Pro has two arms you squeeze together
                          to apply pressure to specific muscles (such as your quads) which also lets
                           you target hard-to-reach areas (here’s looking at you, elbows).

                        Adjustable contoured roller inserts are nontoxic, latex-free, made from EVA (ethylene vinyl
                        acetate — a type of sturdy, yet flexible foam), and are available in medium (green), firm
                        (yellow), or hard (orange), designed to mimic the varying pressure of a physical therapist’s hands.

                        The Rolflex Pro website’s instructional library includes how-to videos with instruction on
                        foam rolling techniques, as well as using the tool for mobility exercises.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Here’s What Happened When I Tried It</b><br>
                        There are no specific guidelines as to how long you should be using the Rolflex
                         Pro on each muscle group for optimal effect — ultimately, it’s up you.

                        I used the Rolflex Pro after my workouts, concentrating on the muscles I’d
                         exerted during that day’s session. I especially loved self-massaging my
                          elbows as I found it was easy to adjust and position the tool around this
                           hard to reach joint. From there, the dual rollers would glide over the
                            I think bony region to roll out my forearms.
                        
                        The high-density roller was better at working into larger muscle groups
                         (particularly my quads and hamstrings), while the lower-density roller
                          suited more sensitive regions around my neck and forearms. That said,
                           switching between roller densities did require a rewind of the
                            instructional video (and a few real-life attempts) before I could 
                            figure it out.
                        
                        I attempted to massage my quadratus lumborum (the deep abdominal muscle
                         located each side of the spine in the lower back) as suggested in the
                          instructional video. This required attaching the multi-strap and reaching 
                          behind my back. Unfortunately, I lack the shoulder flexibility for this and
                           therefore found it uncomfortable. But that’s not to say everyone will
                            experience the same issue.
                        
                        The tool requires regular use for continued results. For this reason,
                         I decided it was best suited for specific areas of pain and tightness,
                          given the process of resizing and resetting the tension to get to each
                           muscle group added 10 to 15 minutes onto my workouts, which wasn’t ideal when
                            I was crunched for time.<br><br>

                        <b>2 Things I Liked About the Rolflex Pro</b><br><br> 
                        <p><b>1. It can be used to target a lot of different muscle groups.</b><br>
                             The Rolflex Pro is a one-stop shop for self-massaging many different muscles.
                              Adjusting the tool’s arms and switching out the therapy rollers allow for many options for using it.

                              <br> <b>2. It lets you target typically hard-to-reach areas with ease.</b><br> 
                            The therapy rollers maneuver easily over problematic areas (hello hamstrings!) 
                            to reach muscles that normally require an extra pair of hands to get at with 
                            a foam roller. I found it especially useful for my neck, elbows, and the back of my knees.
                            
                            <br> <b></b>3. You can use it anywhere, at any time.</b><br>
                             While I enjoy a strenuous workout, I haven’t quite
                              fine-tuned my post-practice stretch, and mainly that’s due to my limited attention
                               span.
